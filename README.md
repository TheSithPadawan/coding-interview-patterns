With this repo, I would like to classify coding interview questions by pattern.

As you know, solving a question on your own does NOT mean that you can solve in an interview.

Thus mastering coding patterns, i.e. thinking the right way, writing the most concise possible code (readable)
is an key aspect in preparing for coding rounds.

Adding more contents as I interview with more companies.
