This is a collection of commonly asked data structure type of problems, which involves
solving the problem using specific data structures, or designing 
a specific data structure to satisfy some need.


Problem list
1. LRU Cache (LinkedList)
2. LFU Cache (Multiset)
3. Insert Delete Random O(1) Duplicates (Vector)
4. Moving average data stream (Deque)
5. All O(1) Data Structure (LinkedList)
6. Design circular queue (LinkedList)
7. Sliding window median / Median in data stream (two heaps); sliding window max
can be solved in multiset in similar fashion
8. Time-based kv store (multiset)
9. Design Auto Complete (Trie + DFS)
10. Skyline (multiset to track maximum height so far)
11. Contains Duplicates III (sliding window pattern + multiset)
12. Sliding window max (deque or multiset)
