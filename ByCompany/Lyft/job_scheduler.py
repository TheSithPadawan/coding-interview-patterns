"""
Coding:
given a list of overlapping job schedules, find minimal number of workers that can process them.
Note: you can create worker if worker is available, worker id starts with 0
requirements:
if there are multiple workers available, use the worker with the smallest index
assumption:
no two jobs have same start time
Output: job and its worker id. sorted by job ID
有几个variation: 求最少需要多少个worker

Example 
3
0134 25
0055 456
2108 145
3指有三个task
每个task 有两部分：起始时间（HHMM格式） 和持续时间(in min)
2108 45 意思是 一个21:08开始的task 持续了45分钟
可以假设 所有task都在0000 and 2359之间开始以及结束
